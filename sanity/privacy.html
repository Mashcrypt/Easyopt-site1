    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Career Unified is an independent, third-party career discovery platform designed
      to help users find publicly available opportunities such as jobs, bursaries,
      universities, and career tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling information responsibly
      in accordance with the <strong>Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)</strong>
      of South Africa and generally accepted data-protection principles.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Career Unified website, tools,
      and content. It explains what information is collected, how it is used,
      and what choices you have.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Career Unified, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Career Unified collects only limited information necessary to operate and improve
      the platform:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search terms and filters used on the site</li>
      <li>Anonymous usage data (pages viewed, interactions)</li>
      <li>CV information entered into the CV Generator (stored locally on your device)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> require account registration and do <strong>not</strong>
      intentionally collect sensitive personal information such as ID numbers,
      banking details, or passwords.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. CV Generator & Local Device Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The CV Generator operates entirely within your browser using local storage.
      This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your CV data remains on your device</li>
      <li>Career Unified does not receive, upload, or store your CV information</li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for managing and protecting this data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Clearing your browser storage will permanently remove saved CV information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Cookies, Local Storage & Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      Career Unified uses cookies and browser storage technologies to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remember user preferences (such as cookie consent)</li>
      <li>Improve platform performance and usability</li>
      <li>Understand general usage trends for improvement purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These technologies do not personally identify you. You may disable cookies
      via your browser, but certain features may not function as intended.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Third-Party Links & External Websites</h2>
    <p>
      Career Unified provides links to external websites, including employers,
      bursary providers, universities, advertisers, and service providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The accuracy of their information</li>
      <li>Their privacy practices or security</li>
      <li>Application outcomes, decisions, or communications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Users interact with external sites entirely at their own discretion and risk.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Accuracy, Availability & Editorial Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      While Career Unified makes reasonable efforts to keep information up to date,
      we do not guarantee the completeness, accuracy, or availability of any listing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content may change, expire, or be withdrawn without notice by third-party providers.
      Editors, contributors, and developers of Career Unified shall not be held liable
      for reliance on outdated or incorrect information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Career Unified, its owners, developers, editors, contributors, and affiliates
      shall not be liable for any direct or indirect loss, damage, or harm arising
      from the use of this platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      This includes, but is not limited to, loss of opportunity, data, income,
      or decisions made based on information found on the site.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. POPIA Explained (Plain Language)</h2>
    <p>
      POPIA is South Africa’s data-protection law that ensures personal information
      is collected lawfully, transparently, and securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under POPIA, you have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Know what data is collected and why</li>
      <li>Access or correct personal information</li>
      <li>Request deletion where applicable</li>
      <li>Expect reasonable safeguards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Career Unified supports these principles by minimizing data collection
      and prioritizing user transparency.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect legal,
      technical, or operational changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continued use of Career Unified after updates constitutes acceptance
      of the revised policy.
    </p>
  </section>
