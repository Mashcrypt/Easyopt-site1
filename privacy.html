    <h2>4. CV Generator & Local Device Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The CV Generator operates entirely within your browser using local storage.
      This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your CV data remains on your device</li>
      <li>Easy Opt does not receive, upload, or store your CV information</li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for managing and protecting this data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Clearing your browser storage will permanently remove saved CV information.
    </p>

    <h2>9. POPIA Explained (Plain Language)</h2>
    <p>
      POPIA is South Africa’s data-protection law that ensures personal information
      is collected lawfully, transparently, and securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under POPIA, you have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Know what data is collected and why</li>
      <li>Access or correct personal information</li>
      <li>Request deletion where applicable</li>
      <li>Expect reasonable safeguards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Easy Opt supports these principles by minimizing data collection
      and prioritizing user transparency.
